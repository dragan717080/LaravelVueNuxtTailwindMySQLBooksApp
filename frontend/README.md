# Radoznali Vrabac Website

## Stack

- Vue
- Nuxt.js
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

## Getting Started

```bash
# clone this repository

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Tips & Info

- Suggesting to use the Nuxt extension for VSCode which automatically starts the Nuxt web app locally. Very convenient.
- Dev local site hangs on route changes, just wait a bit for it to load. This seems to be similar to the [vite bug](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/12157) and should not happen on prod (**NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED**)

## Helpful sites for components

As Vue is componentized, Tailwind actually has quite many ready-made components that are free to use online. You can find some inspiration and ready-made stuff on the following pages. Naturally, you should adapt them and make necessary changes - don't just copy-paste!

SVGs can be found for free on:

- Many of the ones already in use are from [Hashicorp collection](https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/hashicorp-line-interface-icons/)
